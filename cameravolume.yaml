# about the topic...
# The addon will create topics for mean and max volume for each camera.
# Assuming you use the default prefix above ("HA/sensor") and name your
# camera "cam1" as below, you'll get two MQTT message streams with topics:
#      HA/sensor/cam1_audio_volume_max and
#      HA/sensor/cam1_audio_volume_mean
#
# If you are a Frigate user you might want to use the same camera names
# because you'll want to use the topic to define variables that you can
# track or use for automations.

# Cameras.
# Note this assumes your camera has a microphone, in which case
# the sound will be included in the RTSP feed.
# Here if you are using Frigate you can use the very same paths.
#
# If needed, be sure to include your USERNAME, PASSWORD, and IP address(es)
# associated with your camera(s).
